# Networking project for Higher National Diploma in Network Engineering.
☆ Network Design and Implementation Project for White Rock Hotel

This project involves the design and implementation of a comprehensive network for White Rock Hotel. The project covers the entire network infrastructure, including network components, virtualization with high availability, and advanced configurations. This is my second and final project for my Higher National Diploma in Network Engineering. All configurations were done using real components and devices, ensuring a practical and effective network setup for the hotel complex.

☆ The devices used for real scenario configurations:

Pfsense Firewall on VMware - Configured to provide secure internet access and firewall protection.

Dell T30 Server - Utilized for virtualization with vSphere and VCenter for managing virtual machines and ensuring high availability.

DS918+ Synology NAS - Implemented for network-attached storage solutions to support data management and backups.

Cisco Catalyst 2960 24 Port Layer 2 Switch - Deployed for Layer 2 switching and connecting end devices.

Cisco Catalyst 3560 48 Port Layer 3 Switch - Used for Layer 3 switching, enabling inter-VLAN routing and network segmentation.

Windows Server 2016 - Configured with Active Directory, DNS, and DHCP services to manage the hotel's domain and network resources.

This project was meticulously designed to meet the networking needs of White Rock Hotel, providing a robust, secure, and scalable network infrastructure that supports the hotel's operations and services efficiently.
